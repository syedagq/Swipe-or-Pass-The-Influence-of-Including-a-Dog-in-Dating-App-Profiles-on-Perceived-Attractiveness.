Swipe or Pass? The Influence of Including a Dog in Dating App Profiles on Perceived Attractiveness.

Swipe or Pass is an experiment that was run for BA830, Business Experimentation and Causal Methods, a graduate course for my Business Analytics degree at Boston University. 

For this project, our team created a questionnaire on Qualtrics which mimicked the platform of a dating app to understand the likelihood of a male finding a match on a dating app if a picture was posted with a dog. 

After the initial data collection on Qualtrics, our team ran a regression on R to interpret the results and presented our findings. You can briefly read up on the findings on the slide deck, and for a detailed overview can refer to the paper attached.Swipe or Pass is an experiment that was run for BA830, Business Experimentation and Causal Methods, a graduate course for my Business Analytics degree at Boston University.
